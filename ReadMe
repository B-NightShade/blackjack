The main code is in Python flask with Javascript and HTML
The database was done in sqlLight

This is a final project for a software engineering course that allowed 5 players and a dealer to play a game of balckjack. 
This game allowed the players to play on seperate browsers and has a system for picking whoes turn it is.
The players could choose to hit, stay or split their hands (could only split hand once)
current things missing: If a player leaves the game on their turn it does not change the turn to someone else
