# Blackjack Project - Software Engineering Two final

## description
* The main code is in Python flask with Javascript and HTML supporting.
* The database was a sqlLight database
* was a colaborative project with one other partner
* Created prototypes for first few weeks
* Followed a sprint schedule after completing the prototypes
* Participated in code reviews

This is a final project for a software engineering course that allowed 5 players and a dealer to play a game of balckjack. 
This game allowed the players to play on seperate browsers and has a system for picking whoes turn it is.
The players could choose to hit, stay or split their hands (could only split hand once)

## Improvements to make
* current things missing: If a player leaves the game on their turn it does not change the turn to someone else.
* CSS to improve user interface
